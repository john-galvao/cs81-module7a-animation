No part of the code was confusing and writing the comments helped reinforce my understanding of how each variable and function worked.

The animation shows how setInterval runs code repeatedly over time without stopping the rest of the page. The changing symbols and background color make the timing behavior easy to see.

I added a background color change during the animation, which  made the loading process more visually clear and helped show that the code was running in a loop.
